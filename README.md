# Project Euler 014 - Longest Collatz Sequence

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n to n/2 (if n is even)
n to 3n + 1 (if n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

    13,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishes at 1) contains 10 terms.  Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem) it is thought all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under the given `limit` (e.g. 1000000), produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:**Once the chain starts, the terms are allowed to go above `limit`.

The aim is to investigate this using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
